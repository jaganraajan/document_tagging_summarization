  def self.extract_from_pdf(filename)
    # Mock PDF extraction
    <<~TEXT
      This is mock extracted text from a PDF document: #{filename}
      
      PDF documents typically contain formatted text, images, and structured content.
      This simulation represents what would be extracted from a real PDF file.
      
      The document discusses various topics and contains multiple paragraphs
      of relevant information that would be useful for summarization and tagging.
      
      Key points from this document include important concepts, data analysis,
      and conclusions that demonstrate the document's value and purpose.
      
      This mock extraction simulates the text that would normally be extracted
      using PDF processing libraries like PDF-reader or similar tools.

  def self.extract_from_word(filename)
    # Mock Word document extraction
    <<~TEXT
      Mock extracted content from Word document: #{filename}
      
      Microsoft Word documents contain rich text formatting including headers,
      paragraphs, lists, and various styling elements.

  def self.extract_from_text(filename)
    # Mock plain text extraction
    <<~TEXT
      Plain text content from file: #{filename}
      
      This represents a simple text document containing unformatted content.
      Text files are the simplest format but can contain valuable information
      such as configuration data, logs, documentation, or research notes.
      
      The content might include technical specifications, user manuals,
      meeting notes, or other important textual information that requires
      analysis and summarization for better understanding and organization.
      
      Text extraction from plain text files is straightforward but the content
      analysis and categorization still requires intelligent processing.
    TEXT

  def self.extract_from_csv(filename)
    # Mock CSV extraction
    <<~TEXT
      Data extracted from CSV file: #{filename}
      
      CSV File Contents Summary:
      This file contains structured tabular data with multiple rows and columns.
      
      Sample data structure:
      - Header row with column names indicating data categories
      - Multiple data rows containing numerical and text values
      - Statistical information including totals, averages, and trends
      
      The dataset appears to contain business metrics, performance indicators,
      or research data that could be valuable for analysis and reporting.
      
      Key insights from the data include performance trends, categorical breakdowns,
      and statistical summaries that support data-driven decision making.
    TEXT

  def self.extract_from_json(filename)
    # Mock JSON extraction
    <<~TEXT
      Structured data from JSON file: #{filename}
      
      JSON Document Analysis:
      This file contains structured data in JavaScript Object Notation format.
      
      The data structure includes:
      - Nested objects with hierarchical information
      - Arrays containing multiple related items
      - Key-value pairs representing various attributes
      - Configuration settings or application data
      
      The JSON content represents structured information that could include
      API responses, configuration files, or data exports from applications.
      
      This type of structured data is commonly used in web applications,
      APIs, and data exchange between different systems and platforms.
    TEXT

  def self.extract_generic(filename)
    # Mock generic file extraction
    <<~TEXT
      Content extracted from file: #{filename}
      
      This file contains unspecified content that has been processed using
      generic text extraction methods. The extraction process attempts to
      identify and extract readable text content regardless of file format.
      
      The document may contain mixed content including text, metadata,
      and formatting information that has been converted to plain text
      for analysis and processing purposes.
      
      While the specific format is not recognized, the extraction service
      has attempted to preserve the meaningful textual content for
      summarization and tagging operations.
      
      Additional processing may be required to fully understand the
      document's structure and optimize the extraction results.
